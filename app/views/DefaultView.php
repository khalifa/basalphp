Hello stranger!<br>
My name is Samir Palumbo Khalifa, <i>alma mater</i> Federal University of Minas Gerais.<br>
I've developed BasalPHP as a framework that aims to be <b>simple</b> but also <b>practical</b>.<br>
BasalPHP's simplicity makes it perfect for you to learn and apply good programming practices based on the Model-View-Controller software pattern.<br>
BasalPHP's practicality allows you to build whatever you want on top of its framework.<br>
